#How to Run Backend
You will need to install maven. Once that's done you can run the backend by running

```
mvn install
mvn exec:java
```

# How to Run Frontend
Open a new shell and `cd editor-client` and edit `start.sh` to edit the port numbers for your setup. The variables are
* `FRONTEND_SERVER_PORT`: The port to reach the frontend at
* `SERVER_HOST`: The host name of the machine you are running the backend server on.
  * `localhost` works for development, but if you want to share you need to use a publicly accessible IP/hostname
* `SERVER_TCP_PORT`: Port that the backend server listens to TCP connections on.
* `SERVER_WS_PORT`: Port that the backend server listens to Websocket connections on.

You probably only need to edit `SERVER_HOST` to make it work. Then run

```
npm install
./start.sh
``` 

Go to the browser and go to `<HOSTNAME>:8080` to see the editor!
Go ahead and make changes share the link with anyone whom you would like to work with on the document.
